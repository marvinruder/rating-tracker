# Rating Tracker

A web service fetching and providing financial and ESG ratings for stocks.

## Features

#### Stock List with sorting and filtering

Stocks and their information are presented in a paginated table which offers comprehensive and in-depth sorting and filtering by many of the available attributes.

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/docs/images/stocklist-light.png">
  <img alt="Rating Tracker Stock List" src="/docs/images/stocklist-light.png">
</picture>

#### Automatic and scheduled data fetching from several providers

By providing identifiers for stocks from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com), [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.it/it/), [MarketScreener](https://www.marketscreener.com), [MSCI](https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/esg-investing/esg-ratings-climate-search-tool), [LSEG Data & Analytics](https://www.lseg.com/en/data-analytics/sustainable-finance/esg-scores), [Standard & Poor’s](https://www.spglobal.com/esg/solutions/data-intelligence-esg-scores) and [Sustainalytics](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-ratings) in the “Add Stock” dialog, Rating Tracker can automatically fetch financial data as well as financial and ESG ratings. The identifiers to use can be found in the provider’s URL for the stock as shown in the following examples:

-   Yahoo: `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/`**`AAPL`** (This ticker symbol is also the primary identifier for stocks in URLs, database tables etc. If a Yahoo Finance ticker is not available for a stock, an arbitrary ticker can be prefixed with an underscore `_` to indicate that no prices must be fetched for this stock.)
-   Morningstar: `https://tools.morningstar.it/it/stockreport/default.aspx?Site=it&id=`**`0P000000GY`**`&LanguageId=it-IT&SecurityToken=`**`0P000000GY`**`]3]0]E0WWE$$ALL`
-   MarketScreener: `https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/`**`APPLE-INC-4849`**
-   MSCI: `https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/esg-investing/esg-ratings-climate-search-tool/issuer/apple-inc/`**`IID000000002157615`**
-   LSEG Data & Analytics: `https://www.lseg.com/bin/esg/esgsearchresult?ricCode=`**`AAPL.O`** (see also [Refinitiv Identification Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinitiv_Identification_Code))
-   Standard & Poor’s: `https://www.spglobal.com/esg/scores/results?cid=`**`4004205`**
-   Sustainalytics: `https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/`**`apple-inc/1007903183`**

The fetching can be scheduled by providing a Cron-like specifier in an environment variable. See below for details.

#### Stock Logos

When providing an ISIN for a stock, its logo is automatically fetched and cached from TradeRepublic broker.

#### Rating Scores

The fetched ratings of a stock are aggregated to both a financial and ESG score using the average values of all ratings, such that a score of 0 is assigned to an average stock and a score of 100 is assigned to a stock with perfect scores in all underlying ratings.

The financial and ESG score are used to compute a total score using the harmonic mean of both numbers, so that a stock has to perform well in both financial and ESG ratings to obtain a good total score.

#### Watchlists

Stocks noteworthy to a user can be organized in watchlists. A dedicated Favorites watchlist is provided by default and can easily be maintained by clicking the star icon for a stock. 

Users can subscribe to a watchlist, so they receive [notifications](#notification-messages-via-signal) when a stock’s rating is updated.

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/docs/images/watchlists-light.png">
  <img alt="Rating Tracker Watchlists" src="/docs/images/watchlists-light.png">
</picture>

#### Portfolios

Stocks weighted by a given amount of currency can be aggretated in portfolios. The average rating scores of the portfolio can be displayed, as well as the distribution of regions, industry sectors, company sizes and styles of the stocks in the portfolio.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/docs/images/portfolios-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/docs/images/portfolios-light.png">
  <img alt="Rating Tracker Portfolios" src="/docs/images/portfolios-light.png">
</picture>

#### Portfolio Builder

This tool can provide optimal weights of stocks in a portfolio based on the preferred proportions of regions, sectors and other factors.

Stocks can be taken from an existing portfolio, a watchlist, or searched for manually:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/docs/images/portfolio-builder-1-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/docs/images/portfolio-builder-1-light.png">
  <img alt="Rating Tracker Portfolio Builder – Select stocks" src="/docs/images/portfolio-builder-1-light.png">
</picture>

Constraints for regions, sectors, sizes and styles can then be provided, as well as a currency for the portfolio and other settings, such as the total amount to invest, the minimum currency amount per stock or the algorithm to use for proportional representation:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/docs/images/portfolio-builder-2-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/docs/images/portfolio-builder-2-light.png">
  <img alt="Rating Tracker Portfolio Builder – Configure portfolio" src="/docs/images/portfolio-builder-2-light.png">
</picture>

The resulting stock distribution is presented in a histogram-like chart, and differences between target and actual percentages are highlighted:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/docs/images/portfolio-builder-3-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/docs/images/portfolio-builder-3-light.png">
  <img alt="Rating Tracker Portfolio Builder – View results" src="/docs/images/portfolio-builder-3-light.png">
</picture>

The dialog to save the weighted stocks to a new or existing portfolio transparently lists all updates to be made as well as the progress in transferring them to the server:

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/docs/images/portfolio-builder-4-light.png">
  <img alt="Rating Tracker Portfolio Builder – Save results" src="/docs/images/portfolio-builder-4-light.png">
</picture>

#### User Management

The Rating Tracker supports multiple users, who can self-register via WebAuthn and access the application after being granted fine-grained access by an administrator, for whom a “User Management” web interface is provided.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/docs/images/usermanagement-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/docs/images/usermanagement-light.png">
  <img alt="Rating Tracker User Management" src="/docs/images/usermanagement-light.png">
</picture>

<!-- <div id="notification-messages-via-signal"></div> -->

#### Notification Messages via Signal

Based on their access rights, users can subscribe to updates of stock ratings, fetch error reports, or new user registrations by providing a phone number capable of receiving messages via the instant messenger [Signal](https://signal.org).

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/docs/images/profile-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/docs/images/profile-light.png">

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/docs/images/signal-light.png">
  <img alt="Rating Tracker Signal Notifications" src="/docs/images/signal-light.png">
</picture>

#### Error reports with screenshots

When fetching a stock fails, a screenshot of the page the fetch was attempted from is stored and a link to them is sent to stock maintainers who subscribed to error reports, so they can analyze and fix the issue.

#### Logging

Logs are printed to `stdout` as well as rotating log files with [`pino-pretty`](https://yarnpkg.com/package/pino-pretty). While the `stdout` log output is already rendered with beautiful colors and icons in a [p10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)-like fashion (for which a [font supporting all characters](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/font.md) may be required), the log files are JSON-formatted and can be pretty-printed using [`pino-pretty`](https://yarnpkg.com/package/pino-pretty). This tool is included in the Docker image and can be added to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` like this:

```shell
# ~/.zshrc
alias pino-pretty="docker exec -e FORCE_COLOR=1 -i $(docker compose -f <path to docker compose file> ps -q <container name>) pino-pretty -c --config /app/pino-pretty-config.cjs"

# To view (and follow) a log file:
tail -n +1 -f <...>/rating-tracker.log | pino-pretty | less -r
```

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/docs/images/log-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/docs/images/log-light.png">
  <img alt="Rating Tracker Log Output" src="/docs/images/log-light.png">
</picture>

If you prefer a plain log viewer, you can use `pino-pretty` without the configuration file and set the `PLAIN_LOG` environment variable as documented below.

## Demo

An instance of the Rating Tracker is publicly available at https://ratingtracker.mruder.dev, for which access is granted at request.

## Deployment

Rating Tracker is built to be deployed using Docker or a similar container platform.

### Prerequisites

To run Rating Tracker, the following services must be available:

-   [PostgreSQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres), storing information related to stocks and users
-   [Signal Messenger REST API](https://hub.docker.com/r/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api), sending notifications via the Signal messenger
-   [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) or a different reverse proxy, providing SSL encryption (required for most WebAuthn clients)

<!-- <div id="minimal-example-setup-using-docker-compose"></div> -->

### Minimal Example Setup using Docker Compose

Docker Compose is the preferred way to run Rating Tracker together with all the services it depends on. The following configuration file shows an exemplary setup.

<details>
<summary>View Docker Compose configuration</summary>

```yml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:alpine
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: "rating-tracker"
      POSTGRES_USER: "rating-tracker"
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "********"
      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data
    volumes:
      - ./postgresql/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    shm_size: '256mb'

  signal:
    image: bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api
    environment:
      MODE: json-rpc
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./signal-cli:/home/.local/share/signal-cli

  rating-tracker:
    image: marvinruder/rating-tracker
    tty: true # required for colored output to stdout
    init: true # required for graceful shutdown
    environment:
      PORT: 21076
      DOMAIN: "example.com"
      SUBDOMAIN: "ratingtracker"
      TRUSTWORTHY_PROXY_COUNT: 1
      LOG_FILE: "/app/logs/rating-tracker-log-(DATE).log" # (DATE) is replaced by the current date to support log rotation
      DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://rating-tracker:********@postgres:5432/rating-tracker?schema=rating-tracker"
      MAX_FETCH_CONCURRENCY: 4
      AUTO_FETCH_SCHEDULE: "0 0 0 * * *" # this format includes seconds
      SIGNAL_URL: "http://signal:8080"
      SIGNAL_SENDER: "+12345678900"
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:443:21076" # not required if nginx runs in same Docker Compose setup
    volumes:
      - ./logs/rating-tracker:/app/logs
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - signal
    restart: unless-stopped
```
</details>

The port bindings are optional but helpful to connect to the services from the host, e.g. for debugging purposes. 

<!-- <div id="setup-steps"></div> -->

### Setup steps

#### Initialize database setup

Rating Tracker uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) to interact with the PostgreSQL database. At every startup, Prisma Migrate will automatically compare your database with the schema included in the image and create all tables and indexes that are not present yet.

<!-- <div id="create-signal-account"></div> -->

#### Create Signal account

Run a shell in the Signal REST API container and proceed with [this excellent documentation](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/wiki/Quickstart#set-up-an-account).

#### Configure webserver as reverse proxy

After setting up NGINX as a webserver with SSL, the following virtual host configuration can be used to run a reverse proxy:

<details>
<summary>View NGINX configuration</summary>

```nginx
resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=15s; # DNS resolver from Docker to resolve Docker Compose container names

location / {
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    set $target_host rating-tracker; # use 127.0.0.1 here if nginx runs outside of Docker Compose setup
    proxy_pass http://$target_host:21076;
}
```
</details>

#### Initial admin registration

After setting up your Rating Tracker instance, navigate to its URL and register, creating WebAuthn credentials. The first user registered will be granted ultimate access rights automatically. After registering, you can log in using your credentials.

### Supported environment variables

Variables in bold font are mandatory.

<details>
<summary>View complete list of environment variables</summary>

Variable | Example Value | Explanation
---------|---------------|------------
**`PORT`** | `21076` | The TCP port Rating Tracker is served on.
**`DOMAIN`** | `example.com` | The domain Rating Tracker will be available at. This is especially important for WebAuthn, since credentials will only be offered to the user by their client when the domain provided as part of the registration or authentication challence matches the domain of the URL the user navigated to.
`SUBDOMAIN` | `ratingtracker` | An optional subdomain. Credentials created for one domain can be used to authenticate to different Rating Tracker instances served on all subdomains of that domain, making it easy to use multiple deployment stages, development servers etc.
`TRUSTWORTHY_PROXY_COUNT` | `1` | A number of trusted proxies that are allowed to set the `X-Forwarded-For` header to identifier the real IP of a client. If unset, the header is not trusted.
**`DATABASE_URL`** | `postgresql://rating-tracker:********@127.0.0.1:5432/rating-tracker?schema=rating-tracker` | The connection URL of the PostgreSQL instance, specifying username, password, host, port, database and schema. Can also use the PostgreSQL service name (e.g. `postgres` in [this configuration](#minimal-example-setup-using-docker-compose)) as hostname if set up within the same Docker Compose file.
`LOG_FILE` | `/var/log/rating-tracker-(DATE).log` | A file path for storing Rating Tracker log files. The string `(DATE)` will be replaced by the current date. If unset, logs are stored in the `/tmp` directory.
`LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` | The level for the log output to `stdout`. Can be one of `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`. If unset, `info` will be used. 
`PLAIN_LOG` | `1` | If set to a truthy value, the log output to `stdout` will not be rendered with colors and icons.
`AUTO_FETCH_SCHEDULE` | `0 30 2 * * *` | A Cron-like specification of a schedule for when to fetch all stocks from all providers. The format in use includes seconds, so the example value resolves to “every day at 2:30:00 AM”. If unset, no automatic fetching will happen.
`MAX_FETCH_CONCURRENCY` | `4` | The number of fetcher instances used concurrently when fetching information for multiple stocks. If unset, no concurrent fetches will be performed.
`SIGNAL_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | The URL of the Signal REST API. Can also use the Signal REST API service name (e.g. `signal` in [this configuration](#minimal-example-setup-using-docker-compose)) as hostname if set up within the same Docker Compose file. If unset, no Signal notification messages will be sent.
`SIGNAL_SENDER` | `+12345678900` | The phone number of the Signal account registered with the Signal CLI service, which will be used to send notification messages. Read more [here](#create-signal-account) on how to register a Signal account. If unset, no Signal notification messages will be sent.
`SMTP_HOST` | `smtp.example.com` | The hostname of the SMTP server to use for sending emails. If unset, no emails will be sent.
`SMTP_PORT` | `587` | The port of the SMTP server to use for sending emails. If unset, the default port will be used based on the security settings.
`SMTP_SECURITY` | `tls` | The security method to use for the SMTP connection. Can be one of `none`, `tls`, `ssl`. If unset, `none` will be used.
`SMTP_USER` | `ratingtracker` | The username to use for the SMTP connection. If unset, no authentication will be used.
`SMTP_PASS` | `********` | The password to use for the SMTP connection. If unset, no authentication will be used.
`SMTP_FROM` | `ratingtracker@example.com` | The email address to use as the sender of emails. If unset, no emails will be sent.

## API Reference

Any Rating Tracker instance’s API is self-documented, its OpenAPI web interface is hosted at [`/api-docs`](https://ratingtracker.mruder.dev/api-docs). The complete OpenAPI specification document can be downloaded at [`/api-spec/v3.1`](https://ratingtracker.mruder.dev/api-spec/v3.1).

## Development

### Create an environment for developing

An environment with all tools required for developing Rating Tracker and the services it depends on can quickly be created using the VS Code development container configuration included in this repository. The `scripts` section in the [`package.json`](/package.json) provides helpful commands:

-   Clone the repository and open it in Visual Studio Code. When prompted, select “Reopen in Container”. This will create a Docker container with all required tools, recommended extensions and dependencies installed.
-   Check your environment. SSL Certificates must be provided to Vite beforehand, and a Signal account must be created before starting the server (see [section Setup steps](#setup-steps) for details).
-   Run `yarn prisma:migrate:deploy` to initialize the PostgreSQL database.
-   Run `yarn dev` to start the backend server as well as the Vite frontend development server.

Environment variables not included in the development container configuration can easily be defined in an `.env` file:

<details>
<summary>See recommended development environment variables</summary>

```shell
# .env
# # Those variables are already defined in the development container configuration. You only need to define them here if you want to override them.
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://rating-tracker:rating-tracker@postgres:5432/rating-tracker?schema=rating-tracker"
# SIGNAL_URL="http://signal:8080"
# NODE_ENV="development"
# PORT="3001"
# MAX_FETCH_CONCURRENCY="4"
# POSTGRES_USER="rating-tracker"
# POSTGRES_PASS="rating-tracker"
# LOG_LEVEL="trace"

DOMAIN=example.com
SUBDOMAIN=ratingtracker
SIGNAL_SENDER="+12345678900"
# AUTO_FETCH_SCHEDULE=" 0 * * * * *" # This would run every minute, activate for debugging only.
```
</details>

### Run tests

The VS Code development container configuration includes an additional PostgreSQL instance for running tests. To use them, configure your development environment as described above and run `yarn test` to run all tests from all packages. Additionally, the packages’ `package.json` configurations contain a `test:watch` script to run tests in watch mode.
